# CONTRIBUTING

## Guidelines

- Don't commit without using a formatter beforehand
- Don't use the built-in Github Web Editor to commit multi-file changes. I will know if you do this, and I will deny your pull request. If this happens again, you will be blocked.
- Write sensible commit names and descriptions
- [Use imperative commit naming](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3580764)
- If you make any changes to the API interceptors, ensure the tests still pass
- Try your best to follow the style of aero

## Recommendations

- Setup [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/guides/integrate-in-editor/#third-party-plugins) (preferrable) or [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) integrations in your IDE
- If none of tools used suite you, feel free to make a PR for however you like
- If you are on VSCode, install the recommended extensions
- If you want to find something to contribute to, search in your editor for TODO comments and look in TODO.xit for generalized ideas
- If you want to learn aero's codebase faster, **read all of the docs**

### Documentation

- Write in the present simple tense by default, unless you are writing a proposal document, where you would write in the future tense
- Audit your additions using a [grammer checker](https://quillbot.com/grammar-check). If it advises you to rewrite in a passive voice I recommend that you ask a [GPT](https://www.bing.com) to do that, rather than paying for premium.

## How to help without knowledge of programming

You could help write documentation, or find domain fronting exploits.

## Style Guide

### Order of imports

1. Type imports
2. Config imports
3. Standard libraries (Runtime APIs)
4. External libraries
5. Internal libraries

> If there are multiple in each subcategory, then list whichever is used first

### Order of booleans

1. Always check for web compatiblity

### Comment-specific

- If various comments span multiple files, add that topic to .xit. Don't add it to .xit otherwise. These are what you would call milestones.
- Put line-specific comments on the line you are referencing (not before the line)
- If the sentence is multi-lined put a period at the end, if not then don't use periods at all
- If there is only one comment necessary for a line, put the comment after the line itself
- If a comment concerns multiple lines, try to estimate how many lines it covers (E.g. _~4, ..._)
- Put the more specific comments to the issue closer to the actual LOC

### Miscellaneous

- If you are concatinating more than two strings use a template string, or else just the unary operator (+)

## FAQ

### I want to contribute, but I don't know how the SW APIs work

If you have ever used the Fetch API or written a server in a JS runtime, it's literally that but with an event listener for fetch, but you have to keep track of how the SW is registered and there are message channels and caching

Don't be overwhelmed

I recommend reading <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/service-worker-overview> and then <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers>
