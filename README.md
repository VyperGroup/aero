Aero is a safe, developer-friendly, innovative interception web proxy with many features. Aero provides full site support without delay and has a clean, organized codebase. Aero is made to bypass filter restrictions, web restrictions, and bypasses web browser restrictions.

I'm only quitting proxy dev once aero supports everything. AeroSandbox can sandbox everything (remove all web restrictions, too), and my Proxy Dev Guide is so detailed with examples that it contains explanations and code examples to make your proxy that supports everything.

## What is a web proxy?

Web proxies are website libraries that work to emulate the functionality of the site that you want. They do this by intercepting API calls and rewriting documents to emulate as if it was under the proxied origin.

Web Proxies can be used for:

- Bypassing **any** browsing restrictions in a sandbox
- Unblocking websites or **browser features** through emulation
- Middleware

## How to build aero

A lot of types in aero are autogenerated when you run any of these build scripts once. The same applies to AeroSandbox.

```bash
npm i
npm run buildSW
npm --profile=src/AeroSandbox i
npm --profile=src/AeroSandbox run build
```

> Since these are production builds the bundles will be in `...dist/prod/...`
> ⚠️ There are currently issues building aero with `pnpm`, so please refrain from using it at the moment

## How to live debug aero (how to run the aero dev server)

> ⚠️ This dev server isn't meant to be used as a demo, but it certainly can be if you run without the live build scripts. You can pre-build the production builds and run `npm run buildSW`. There will be an actual demo server like described [here](./docs/Plans/Aero%20Live%20Deployment%20Page.md).
> Be sure to [enable Source Maps](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/source-maps#enable_source_maps_in_settings) when debugging

1. Install pm2
2. Execute these commands

  ```bash
  ./deps.sh
  npm start
  ```

> Run `git pull` and then run these commands again to update the dev server
> The port by default is **:2525**

### To debug the bundles

Run

```bash
npm run rsdoctor
```

> You should share those Rsdoctor ports if you are on a VSCode live share with collaborators

## How to build with your own feature flags

TODO: Rename createFeatureFlags.ts to createDefaultFeatureFlags.ts
TODO: Encourage creating `createFeatureFlags.ts`, which can override what is in `createDefaultFeatureFlag.ts`
TODO: Normally import `createDefaultFeatureFlags.ts` and dynamically import `createFeatureFlags.ts` THEN run the rest of the build code
TODO: Do the same for AeroSandbox

### With VSCode

```bash
./deps.sh
```

In your editor: Press `f5` or `Menu -> Run -> Start Debugging`

### Notes

- You must run `pm2 restart <aero-build-watch/aero-sandbox-build-watch>` whenever you modify a compile-time Feature Flag for it to apply regardless if you are in a live build

## How to run unit tests

It is highly recommended that you install [aero middleware](https://github.com/vortexdeveloperlabs/proxy-middleware) for enhanced functionality.

Nobody is unqualified to work on aero
Don't worry; you will figure out how aero works with our fantastic dev docs. Remember, if you have ideas for how to improve the docs, please suggest them
I appreciate all of you 💖
